DSA


Arrays
   1. insert(int val) - inserts the value after the last element in the array
   2. removeAt(int index) - removes a value at a given index and updates the elements right to it to correct positions
   3. indexOf(int val) - returns the index of a given value, if the element is not present, returns -1
   4. max() - returns the maximum element in the array
   5. intersect(int[] items1) - prints the elements that are common from the given array
   6. reverse() - reverses the array in place
   7. insertAt(int item, int index) - inserts the element at the given index and rearranges the elements right to it
   8. print() - prints the elements in the array


LinkedList
   1. addLast(int value) - adds a new node to the tail and updates the tail
   2. addFirst(int value) - adds a  new node to the head and updates the head
   3. isEmpty() - check if the linked list is empty
   4. indexOf(int value) - return the index of the node which contains the given value
   5. contains(int value) - checks if the given value is in any node of the list
   6. removeFirst() - removes the head node and updates the head node
   7. size() - returns the size of the list
   8. toArray() - converts the linked list to an array
   9. getPrev(Node node) - return the node that is previous to the given node
   10. reverse() - reverses the linked list in one pass
   11. getKthNodeFromLast(int k) - returns the kth node from the end of the list in one pass
   12. printMiddle() - prints the middle of the element in one pass
   13. hasLoop() - checks if the linked list has a loop


Stack
   1. StringReverser - provides a method called "reverse" which will return the reversal of the input string
   2. BalancedExpressions - provides a method called "isBalanced" which will return if the given input string is valid
   3. Stack  - Implemented the operation push, pop, peek, empty of  a stack using an array
   4. TwoStacks - Implemented two stacks with all the operations of a stack using a single array in space sufficient manner
   5. MinStack - Implemented a stack that supports push, pop, and retrieving the minimum value in constant time


Queues 
   1. ReversingQueue - Implemented the method to reverse any given queue
   2. ArrayQueue - Implemented enqueue, dequeue, peek, isFull, and isEmpty operations of a queue using an array
   3. PriorityQueue - Implemented  Priority Queue using an array
   4. QueueWithTwoStacks - Implemented queue with two stacks supporting all the operations of a queue
   5. QueueReverser - Implemented the reverse method to reverse the first k elements of a given queue
   6. LinkedListQueue - Implemented queue using a linked list supporting all the operations of a queue
   7. StackWithTwoQueues - Implemented a stack using two queues supporting all the operations of a stack


Hash Tables

   1. CharFinder - Implements two methods to find the first repeating character and first non-repeating character
   2. CountPairs - Implements method to find the unique number of pairs in a given array with k difference
   3. HashTable - Implements operations like put, remove, and get of a HashTable from scratch using chaining
   4. MostFrequentElement - Implements method to find the most repeating character in a given array
   5. TwoSum - Implements method to find the pair of integers in a given array which sum up to given target
